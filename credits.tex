For this project, Davis wrote most of the code for PCA.R. He researched the R syntax for using PCA in R, in addition to the writeJPEG library for outputting image files. Jason assisted with researching how to do PCA in R as well as using the Naive Bayes classifier. Yukio assisted in putting together the classifier; he also wrote the early version of MLE.R before we ended up switching to the R library for that purpose. All three members were involved with putting together the powerpoint for the presentation as well as writing the final paper.
